checkprocess.sh has discovered the twitter-streamer-V1.py script 
is no longer running.

*** This means that the Twitter stream broke within the last minute. ***

The cron job which discovered this problem is designed to automatically
restart the persistent-streamer.sh script. 

This script creates an infinite bash while-loop that continuously 
restarts the twitter-streamer-V1.py streaming script in case it falls
over again.

As a result, the problem *should* be fixed and another stream is likely
up and running already. 

*** However, make sure you check everything restarted correctly. ***

With love,
